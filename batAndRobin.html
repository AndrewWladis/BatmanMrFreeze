        <h2>You and Robin are in the batcave. There is a an Ice Blimp over Gotham City. It is most likely Mr Freeze. It is 6000 feet in the air. From that distance, using a Freeze Ray, he could freeze the whole city. You and Robin fly up to the blimp. You enter the blimp. You see Mr Freeze's dead body. The body falls. You see who was holding the body up. It was Kite-Man. "Hell Yeah!" he says. "You can't do this" Robin says. The Ice Ray starts up. Kite-Man takes Robin. He is about to throw Robin off of the blimp. What do you do?</h2>
