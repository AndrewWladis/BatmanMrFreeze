        <h2>You are playing on HiPixel with Beast Boy. Kite-Man is in the game. He kills you. You are so mad you scream and throw your phone on the ground. Your manager comes over and fires you. You cry and take the bus home. Batman makes you become a janitor. Your whole life falls apart. You lose in Minecraft and in the real world.</h2>
